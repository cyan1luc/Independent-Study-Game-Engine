# Independent-Study-Game-Engine

This is a game engine for an independent study class I took at Loyola. Currently this only contains some pseudocode and comments where the body of the functions should be, but there are some functions that have logic. The first step towards creating the game engine came with establishing the modules I will be using, along with some initial functions I created. The GameEngine JS file contains all the other modules with the imports and exports it for use by the Clients JS file. This way it keeps the design modular and provides an access point through the GameEngine.
